This module changes the PoS product selection UX. Instead of displaying all the product variants,
the PoS will display only product templates. When you select any product template, a new popup
screen will appear to help you choose attributes.

This is mostly useful when you have a large number of product variants: it is more user-friendly
to choose attribute values one by one instead of looking around 100's of icons to choose the right one.
